TuniMining collects data using social media APIs and performs sentiment analysis to get meaningful insight behind the data about relevant subjects in Tunisia. 

The application is devided into 4 main sub-systems:

:fuelpump: <b> Data Acquisition System :</b> 

Extracting comments of Tunisian users with Facebook Graph API and Youtube API.

:bath: <b> Data Cleaning System :</b>

The cleaning of the comment text is based on normalizing the data and removing useless terms in order to smooth the matching with the pre-established sentiment dictionary.

:heart: <b> Sentiment Analysis :</b> 

Determining the polarity of the comments based on a sentiment dictionary approach. The dictionary was built manually based on the commonly used tunisian dialect expressions (in both latin and arabic characters) and a subjective scoring system.

:bar_chart: <b> Visualization Tool </b> 

The results of the analysis will be displayed in the form of trend diagrams which indicate diï¬€erent levels of popularity and polarity.
